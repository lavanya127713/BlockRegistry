🏡 Land Registration Using Blockchain

A secure, transparent, and decentralized land management system built using **Ethereum Blockchain, Solidity, Flutter, and Web3**.

The **Land Registration Using Blockchain** project transforms the traditional land management process by eliminating fraud, reducing manual errors, and ensuring trust through decentralization. By storing land records on the blockchain and integrating them with a modern mobile application, the system enables **tamper-proof ownership records, secure identity verification, and seamless ownership transfers**.

This solution is designed for governments, land authorities, and users who seek a **transparent, immutable, and efficient land registration process**.

🌟 Key Highlights

🔐 **Blockchain-Powered Land Registry**

All land records, ownership details, verification statuses, and transfer events are stored on the **Ethereum blockchain**, ensuring data integrity and resistance to tampering.

📱 **Mobile App Built with Flutter**

A user-friendly Flutter-based interface allows:

* Easy land registration
* Online verification by inspectors
* Viewing property details
* Initiating and receiving ownership transfers

👮 **Role-Based Access Control**

The system supports three major user roles:

* **User** – Apply for land, view properties, transfer ownership
* **Land Inspector** – Validate user identity, approve land registration, verify transfers
* **Contract Owner (Admin)** – Manage inspectors, oversee system operations

🔁 **Secure Ownership Transfer**

Ownership transfers require:

* Request initiation
* Inspector verification
* Blockchain confirmation

Ensuring **zero chance of fraudulent land exchange**.

🛠️ Tech Stack Overview

**Blockchain**

* Solidity Smart Contracts
* Truffle Suite (Compile & Deploy)
* Ganache (Local Blockchain)

**Frontend & Wallet Integration**

* Flutter
* Dart
* Web3dart
* Metamask / WalletConnect

🎯 Why This Project?

Traditional land record systems face major issues:
⛔ Fraudulent land transactions
⛔ Manual and slow verification
⛔ Document tampering
⛔ Lack of transparency
⛔ Corrupt intermediaries

This project addresses all these challenges using **trustless blockchain technology**, ensuring that no single authority can manipulate records.
